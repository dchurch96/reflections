How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Being able to see the difference between the original and the second one
using a diff made it a lot more simple and less tedious to try and read 
through the code look ing for errors.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programer in the long term?

Being able to view past files allows you to make sure you are not just 
trying the same thing over and over again but instead you are creating 
new ideas.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The pros and cons are that you get to decided how big you would like 
each commit to be but at the same time if you forget to save then you 
are up teh creek without a paddle.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Different systems treat files differently based off of what they are 
primarily used for.  Programmers use functions for many different 
things which are all tied to one program while they may be in seperate 
files while writing a paper would not require something similar to this.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

the git log command shows all of the old commits and if you use the git 
diff command you can see what has changed between these two different 
comits.
